# You Dirty Dog Menu Code
This C++ code provides a menu for a dog grooming business. The user can choose to enter a new job or list all current jobs. The code prompts the user to enter information for each job, including the dog's name, license number, owner's phone number, and price. The program also performs error checking on the user's input to ensure that all entered data is valid.

# How to Run the Code
To run the code, simply compile the code using your C++ compiler and execute the resulting executable. The code should work on any platform that supports C++.

# How to Use the Menu
Upon running the program, the user will be presented with the following menu:

You Dirty Dog Menu: 

(1) Enter a new job

(2) List all current jobs

(3) Exit

To select an option, simply enter the corresponding number and press enter.

If the user selects option 1, they will be prompted to enter information for a new job. The program will ask for the dog's name, license number, owner's phone number, and the quoted price for the job. The program will also perform error checking on the user's input to ensure that all entered data is valid.

If the user selects option 2, the program will display all current jobs. It will also report the number of jobs and the total cost of all jobs.

If the user selects option 3, the program will exit.

# How to Modify the Code
If you wish to modify the code, you can add or remove input validation for the user's input or modify the Inventory class to add more functionality. If you want to change the maximum number of jobs that can be entered, simply change the value of the ARRAY_SIZE constant.

You can also modify the code to work with a different type of business by changing the prompt messages and the information that is displayed for each job.
